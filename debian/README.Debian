zfs-linux for Debian

1. Feature flags are enabled by default.

This means that ZoL will now create pools in a way that is
incompatible with Solaris. If you need Solaris compatibility,
then create pools like this:

  # zpool create -o version=28 tank ...

ZoL remains compatible with all other ZFS implementations derived
from Illumos.
