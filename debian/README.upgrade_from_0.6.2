If you have just upgraded from 0.6.2 and if you're booting of a ZFS
filesystem, this documentation is for you!


Because of huge changes in the libraries of ZoL (technically: 'ABI
changes'), after the upgrade it will look like your pools doesn't
exist.

This will result in programs that need to access pool information  to
fail. One such program discovered at date, is 'grub-probe'.  It will
segfault, because it can not retreive the information it needs to
work.

The problem looks like this:

     hostname:~# zpool status
     no pools available

A reboot should solve this issue, but efore you reboot, make sure that
there is no problem with the boot command line!

Run the following command:

    egrep '[[:space:]]linux[[:space:]]' /boot/grub/grub.cfg

If the 'root=' parameter is empty and/or there is no 'boot=zfs' in
there, you will unfortunatly have to edit the grub config file
manually. It can not be done automatically.

So if the above command results in something like this:

        linux   /vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-amd64 root= ro   quiet
                linux   /vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-amd64 root= ro   quiet
                linux   /vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-amd64 raot= ro   single

Here, the config file have been updated, but grub have not been able
to figure out what to boot (possibly because grub-probe does not
work properly).

So control what the current command line looks like using the
following command:

    cat /proc/cmdline

It might return something like:

    BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-3.2.0-4-amd64 bootfs=rpool/ROOT/debian-1 ro boot=zfs quiet

Here, I'm booting from the 'rpool/ROOT/debian-1' dataset.

So edit your grub.cfg file, replace the ' root= ro' string with
' bootfs=rpool/ROOT/debian-1 boot=zfs ro' instead.


If you are unsure how to proceed, feel free to ask the ZoL list
before continuing with the reboot. Or keep a ZFS rescue CD handy...
